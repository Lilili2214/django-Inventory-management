# Inventory Management System

## Project Description
I developed an inventory management system using Django and SQLite to streamline the process of tracking staff, products, and orders within an organization. The system serves as a centralized platform to manage inventory-related tasks efficiently and accurately.

## Key Features
1. **User Authentication:** Implemented user authentication and authorization using Django's built-in authentication system. Staff members can log in securely to access the system based on their roles and permissions.
   
2. **Staff Management:** Created CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing staff information, including details such as name, position, contact information, and role within the organization.
   
3. **Product Management:** Implemented CRUD operations for managing product inventory, including adding new products, updating existing product details, and removing products from inventory. Each product record contains information such as name, description, quantity, price, and category.
   
4. **Order Management:** Developed a comprehensive order management system to track customer orders, including order creation, modification, and cancellation. Each order record includes details such as order ID, customer information, product items, quantity, total amount, and order status.
   
5. **Data Visualization:** Integrated chart visualization tools (e.g., Chart.js or Plotly) to generate insightful charts and graphs based on inventory data. Visualizations include sales trends, product categories, inventory levels, and order status distribution, providing valuable insights for decision-making.
   
6. **CRUD Operations:** Implemented CRUD functionality throughout the system to allow users to create, read, update, and delete records seamlessly. CRUD operations ensure data integrity and flexibility in managing inventory-related information.
   
7. **Responsive Design:** Developed a responsive user interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap framework to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes. The system adapts dynamically to different screen resolutions, providing a consistent user experience.

## Technologies Used
- Django (Python web framework)
- SQLite (Relational database management system)
- HTML5, CSS3
- Bootstrap (Front-end framework)
- Chart.js or Plotly (Data visualization libraries)
- CRUD Operations
- User Authentication and Authorization
- Responsive Web Design

## Conclusion
The inventory management system represents a comprehensive solution for organizations to efficiently manage inventory, track staff, products, and orders, and gain valuable insights through data visualization. Developed using Django and SQLite, the system offers robust functionality, intuitive user interface, and scalability to meet the evolving needs of businesses in inventory management.
